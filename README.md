# 100 Projects

I'll try to create 100 projects to enhance my skills as a full-stack developer.
I aim to achieve this goal by practicing every single day.

These 100 projects will be divided into branches. In the main branch, you'll
find the first 25 projects. In the branch called `26-50` you'll find projects
from 26 to 50, and so on.

The idea was originally created in the [Binary Brains](https://www.instagram.com/bbupiicsa/), the programming group I'm in
